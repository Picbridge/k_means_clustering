# k_means_clustering

This project is made to run the *k*-means clustering algorithm to re-color an image with *k* colors only.

## How it works

The original input file:

![Original](https://github.com/Picbridge/k_means_clustering/blob/main/OutputImages/input.jpg)

* *k*: 3

![k3](https://github.com/Picbridge/k_means_clustering/blob/main/OutputImages/k_3.jpg)

* *k*: 4

![k4](https://github.com/Picbridge/k_means_clustering/blob/main/OutputImages/k_4.jpg)

* *k*: 5

![k5](https://github.com/Picbridge/k_means_clustering/blob/main/OutputImages/k_5.jpg)

The number of colors used varies by *k*

## How to use

1. Download the py file, and put image to work on in the working folder.
2. Modify the value of *k* (defalut is *k* = 4)
3. Run the program.
